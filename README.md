# Thirds ColorBar

## Description
The **Thirds ColorBar** indicator for ATAS is a visual tool that colors chart candles based on where the closing price falls within the candle's range. It divides each candle's range into three equal parts and assigns a specific color depending on where the closing price is located.

## How It Works
The indicator works as follows:
- **Top Color (Buy Candle)**: Applied when the closing price is in the upper third of the candle's range.
- **Middle Color (Doji Candle)**: Applied when the closing price is in the middle third of the candle's range.
- **Bottom Color (Sell Candle)**: Applied when the closing price is in the lower third of the candle's range.
